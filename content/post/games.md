## So, why games?
<p>
	More often than not I choose to play video games as the primary form of personal entertainment. I am interested in their intellectual and artistic values, choosing games that are strongly single-player and story-driven over others lacking those qualities.

	I've learned that if you're going to write about something it helps to have some idea of what others are writing on the same topic. For example, if I want to write about games I like to read [Jim Sterling's blog](http://www.thejimquisition.com), a few reviews on Steam and Kotaku. I guess this idea was born in my mind as *have to find validation in other authors' writing*, but truly became *yes, and we should also talk about this!*
